    <Description>
      Define the interfaces or shared services for plugins.
      These interfaces will be called in your application, and implemented in your plugins.
      The shared services will be registered in your application, and injected into your plugins.
      The services those only used in your plugins should be defined in your plugin's references and registered in your plugins, not here.
